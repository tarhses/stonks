# :moneybag: Stonks Online

**Stonks** is an online clone of the German board game _Kuhhandel_ (also known in different languages as "_You're Bluffing_", "_Boursicocotte_", "_Koehandel_" and "_Pague para ver!_" according to Wikipedia). It uses Node, Express, React and Socket.io and was made as a learning project for modern web development.

## :wrench: Usage

### Playing

A public server is currently running on https://stonks-online.herokuapp.com/. You're free to test it, some feedback is welcome as well :smile:.

### Installation

You can start a server using the npm package manager. It will listen to port 8080 by default. This behavior can be changed by defining the `PORT` environment variable.

Here are the available commands :

```shell
# Install Stonks with all its dependencies
$ npm install

# Build and start the server in production mode
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# Start the server in development mode,
# restarting when any file changes (using nodemon and webpack --watch)
$ npm run watch
```
